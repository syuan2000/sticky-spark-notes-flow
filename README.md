# 🗒️ Sticky Notes App

A lightweight, drag-and-drop sticky notes web application that helps users organize thoughts, tasks, and ideas — inspired by the simplicity of Mac Notes, but with more flexibility and a playful UI.

## 📌 Overview

Sticky Notes lets you:

- Create and edit notes quickly
- Organize notes into folders
- Drag and drop notes between folders (with hover effects!)
- View all your notes in one place (`All Notes`)
- Pin important notes for quick access
- Save data locally, with optional sync support (coming soon)

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted a personal sticky note organizer app that felt as lightweight with better digital organization.  

This project was a chance to:

- Build a **React-based web app** focused on fast interactions
- Solve a personal need for quick, visual note organization
